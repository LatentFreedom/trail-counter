#### Personal Goals Statement ####
##################################

* Who are the members of your team?
1. Nick Palumbo (npalumbo)
2. Isaac Fisch (ifisch)

* What is the URL of your team's repository?
https://github.iu.edu/npalumbo/trailcounter

* What are your personal learning objectives for this project? What one area of the project is most interesting to you?
My personal learning objectives for this project are learning more about making a device that is both memory and energy efficient. When implementing the trail counter we have to make the batter last hopefully around a year and being able to add the functionality of sleeping/waking/suspending processes so that the energy is not used on unneeded processes will be helpful knowledge.
Another area is bluetooth. I am interesting in being able to pull information from a device that is not directly connected to a computer. Being able to collect data over the air is interesting and is needed for most devices made.

* Do you have any concerns about your team or the project?
The only concerns I have about the project are time constraints when it comes to implementing our added functionality that we get to choose. I want to add bluetooth functionality but may not be able to given the time it takes to learn how to actually implement it. I want to be able to do this and hope that it is easier then you guys make it sound.
