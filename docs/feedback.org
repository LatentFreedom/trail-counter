- [58] Concept Design Document
  + [10] Introduction :: 10 points
    * High level overview of your project
  + [10] Background :: 10 points
    * [5] research on other trail counters present
    * [5] Discussion about your approach
  + [12] Feature Description :: 15 points
       all obvious features described 
       -2 points for missing feature
       -1 point for not understanding feature
    + target counter accuracy 60%
    + power source
    + configured with a unique ID and current time
    + secure bluetooth connection
    + 8 month battery life
    + enters low power states to save energy
    - [2] method update configuration of device not mentioned until milestones
  + [9] Block Diagram :: 15 points
    * [0] Block diagram present
      - The purpose of the block diagram is to describe your
        system not the platform that you are building it on.
        Are you going to use all of the hardware in this block
        diagram? Implying that the title of the cell of the
        rubric should have been "Your block diagram present".
    * [4] All components present
      - You are missing the battery in the system
    * [5] Logical relationships between components
  + [9] Theory of Operation :: 25 points
    * [9] Discussion of all aspects in feature description
     + [10] counting some the description from features section
       as details discussed here.
     - [1] How did you estimate battery life?
     - What interface does the initial configurations use?
    * [0] Implementation details in place
      - [15] There are no details of the implementation of the features described.
      - How do you setup a bluetooth connection?
      - How do you enter / exit low power states?
      - How do you load new firmware into memory?
      - How do you keep track of real time when you enter low-power mode?
      - For each feature what do you need to do in order to get
        that feature working in the prototype?
      - For example if you use the cellular modem how are you going
        to go about connecting to it, interacting with it, and 
        sending data over it? In very concrete terms, what is the
        interface provided by the cellular modem, and how will
        that affect your design and schedule? 
    * [0] Missing items mentioned as further research could add back some points
  + [8] Schedule / Milestones :: 10 points 
    * [3] weekly schedule for each feature mentioned
      - scheduled milestones but not each feature
    * [5] description of the milestones
    * I am uncertain whether the firmware update is within the difficulty
      range acceptable for these projects, because I am uncertain
      how to do this myself. 
    * I think it would be just as acceptable to include bluetooth as your
      milestone 4 goal and have the authentication as a stretch goal.
